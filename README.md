# aputhin's Next.js Demo

A small [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project for testing out stuff. Most of it following Next's own [learning guide](https://nextjs.org/learn/) and building up from it.

If it looks like a mess, it's because it actually is. This is actually a sandbox for testing rather than a demo of a working web app.
